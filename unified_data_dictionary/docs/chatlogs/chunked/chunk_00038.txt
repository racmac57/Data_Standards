with tailored chunk sizes, redaction, audit levels, and priority settings
- **Auto-Archival**: Optional weekly archival of old output sessions (>90 days) to `03_archive/consolidated/YYYY/MM/` with configurable threshold
- **Long Path Handling**: Automatic path shortening for Windows MAX_PATH limits (>240 characters) using hash-based folder names
- **Version Conflict Resolution**: Automatic `_v2`, `_v3` suffix handling for sidecars and manifests to prevent overwrites

### Changed
- **watcher_splitter.py**: Added `_age_minutes()` and `is_effectively_stable()` helpers to skip stability checks for old files, implemented batch size limiting, and enhanced parallel processing options
- **config.json**: Added `batch_size` (100), `stability_skip_minutes` (10), `use_multiprocessing` (false), `multiprocessing_fallback` (true), `archive_old_outputs` (true), and `archive_after_days` (90)
- **Performance**: Reduced processing time for 6,500 files from ~3.5 hours to ~53 minutes (90% improvement) by bypassing stability checks on old files and implementing batch processing
- **Department Detection**: Enhanced `get_department_config()` to use file extensions, filename/path keywords, and metadata tags with priority-based matching

### Performance
- **Large Backlog Processing**: 6,500 files processed in ~53 minutes (average 4.03 seconds per file with 8 parallel workers)
- **Stability Check Bypass**: Files >10 minutes old skip 2-second stability checks, eliminating ~3.5 hours of wait time on large backlogs
- **Batch Size Control**: Limited to 100 files per cycle to prevent system overload while maintaining throughput
- **Parallel Processing**: Thread pool (default) or process pool (optional) with automatic fallback on errors

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with v2.1.9 performance improvements and configuration options
- Updated SUMMARY.md with latest changes and performance metrics
- CHANGELOG.md entries for all v2.1.9 improvements

### Migration & Archive
- Successfully migrated 15,612 files (4.55 GB) from local directories to OneDrive
- 109 files skipped due to Windows MAX_PATH limit (logged separately)
- Archive reprocessing supports enhanced tagging and department detection

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Emergency Services Departments**: Added `fire` and `ems` department configurations with high-priority processing, enhanced redaction, and optimized chunk sizes (90 sentences) for sensitive incident and patient data
- **Tiny File Archiving**: Files under 100 bytes are now automatically archived to `03_archive/skipped_files/` along with their manifests to prevent repeated processing warnings (watcher_splitter.py:677-703). - **Database Lock Monitoring**: Created `MONITOR_DB_LOCKS.md` with comprehensive monitoring commands, alert thresholds, and 24-48 hour review schedule for tracking SQLite contention patterns. - **Windows UTF-8 Troubleshooting**: Updated README/SUMMARY with steps for switching PowerShell to UTF-8 to avoid Unicode logging failures on emoji filenames. - **Streamlit GUI Doc**: Added `streamlit run gui_app.py` workflow to README and SUMMARY so users can launch the browser-based search interface. - **Chunker Bridge Compatibility**: Watcher now understands `.part` staging files and optional `.ready` markers produced by upstream bridges, keeping them off the work queue until the final rename is complete. - **Batched Vector Ingest**: `ChromaRAG.add_chunks_bulk()` accepts batches (configurable via `batch.size`) and skips null embeddings while refreshing `hnsw:search_ef` from `search.ef_search`. - **Analytics CLI**: Added `analytics_cli.py` plus npm alias `kb:analytics` for quick daily/weekly stats dumps from `chunker_tracking.db`. - **Watcher Performance Guards**: Added an LRU cache around sentence tokenization, a dedicated metrics executor, and a rate limiter that caps repeated notifications to once every 60 seconds per key. - **Process Pool Batch Mode**: Introduced optional `multiprocessing.Pool` handling (config flag) for heavy backlogs and automatic pruning of the `processed_files` cache past 1,000 entries. - **SQLite Integrity Check**: `ChunkerDatabase.run_integrity_check()` validates the database at startup while a centralized `_conn()` helper enforces 60 s timeouts and WAL pragmas. - **Pytest Guardrails**: Root-level `conftest.py` ignores bulky `99_doc/legacy` fixtures and `tests/test_db.py` smoke-tests the SQLite retry path. ### Changed
- **Small File Handling**: Changed log level from WARNING to INFO for small file archiving since this is now expected behavior rather than an error condition. - **Archive Organization**: Added `skipped_files/` subfolder in archive directory to separate tiny/invalid files from successfully processed files. - **Watcher Retry Safety**: All sequential and parallel processing paths funnel through `process_with_retries()`, quarantining persistent failures to `03_archive/failed` after exponential backoff and copying any associated `.ready` files. - **Configuration Defaults**: New keys `debounce_window`, `use_ready_signal`, `failed_dir`, `batch. {size,flush_every,mem_soft_limit_mb}`, and `search.ef_search` expose watcher deferrals and vector-store tuning directly in `config.json`. - **Chunk Writer Robustness**: Consolidated `write_chunk_files()` helper pre-creates the parent once, writes UTF-8 chunks with defensive logging, guarantees manifest copy directories exist, and re-hashes content when manifests lack checksums while skipping any path containing `.origin.json`. - **SQLite Error Logging**: `chunker_db.log_error` now supports legacy/modern signatures, retries locked inserts with exponential backoff, and sits atop the shared `_conn()` plumbing so every path enjoys consistent 60 s timeouts; startup now runs `run_integrity_check()` and logs anomalies. - **Requirements Hygiene**: Simplified `requirements.txt` to unpinned dependency names and explicitly include `portalocker`, avoiding pip resolution failures on Python 3.13. ### Analysis & Documentation
- **DB Lock Error Analysis**: Detailed breakdown showing 11 `log_processing()` errors vs 1 `_update_department_stats()` error over 8-minute test period (1.5 errors/min baseline, down 68% from previous baseline). - **Retry Logic Review**: Documented current retry configuration (get_connection: 3 retries, dept_stats: 5 retries with 1.5x backoff), identified that `log_processing()` lacks retry wrapper as potential future improvement. - **Monitoring Plan**: Established alert thresholds (> 3 errors/min = 2x baseline) and pattern analysis commands for time-based clustering, processing volume correlation, and error duration tracking. ### Fixed
- **Repeated Warnings**: Eliminated log spam from files that don't meet minimum size threshold by archiving them on first detection instead of skipping repeatedly. - **Log Clutter**: Reduced noise in watcher logs by moving tiny files out of the watch folder automatically. ### Planned
- Additional performance optimizations
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Consider adding retry wrapper to `log_processing()` if monitoring shows sustained > 3 errors/minute
