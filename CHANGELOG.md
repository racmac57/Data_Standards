## [v2.2.0] - 2026-01-17

### Migration Complete - UDD Hybrid Migration Executed

**UDD Hybrid Migration - Successfully Completed**

#### Migration Actions Completed
- ✅ Moved `unified_data_dictionary/` → `tools/unified_data_dictionary/` (Python package preserved)
- ✅ Extracted reference data to root: `schemas/udd/` (9 files), `mappings/field_mappings/` (12 files)
- ✅ Organized standalone scripts: `scripts/validation/`, `scripts/extraction/`
- ✅ Moved documentation: `docs/html/`, `docs/generated/`
- ✅ Cleaned extracted data from tool location
- ✅ Git commit: `46577f2` - feat(migration): Complete UDD hybrid migration to tools/

#### Results
- **252 files** reorganized and committed
- Python package structure intact and functional
- Reference data now at Standards root (ready for NIBRS additions)
- Cleaner directory structure achieved

#### Known Issues
- Old `unified_data_dictionary/` directory has recursive symlink issue (locked by process)
- Can be manually removed after system restart
- Does not affect functionality

#### Next Steps
- Update external systems (Power BI, ETL scripts) to use new paths
- Consider creating symbolic links if external systems need gradual migration
- Remove old directory after process unlock

#### Code Header Standards

**Implemented standardized headers for all code artifacts**
- Format: 🕒 timestamp (EST), project path, author (R. A. Carucci), purpose
- Language-specific comment symbols:
  - Python: `#`
  - PowerShell: `#`
  - M Code/JavaScript: `//`
  - VBA: `'`
  - SQL: `--`
- Applied to all migration scripts and documentation

#### Pre-Flight Validation Results

**All Critical Checks Passed** ✅
- **UDD tool functionality**: `pip install -e .` → SUCCESS
- **CLI functionality**: `udd --help` → SUCCESS
- **Test suite**: `pytest` → ALL TESTS PASS
- **Python package structure**: Sound, no breaking changes found
- **Import dependencies**: All valid, relative imports work
- **Configuration files**: No path issues found
- **Git status**: Clean, on feature branch
- **Backup created**: **139,390 files** at `C:\Temp\Standards_Backup_20260116_181122`
- **Migration branch created**: `feature/udd-hybrid-migration`

**Risk Assessment** ⚠️
- **External dependencies confirmed**: Power BI reports and ETL scripts reference UDD paths
- **Highest risk**: External system breakage if paths not updated
- **Recommendation**: Symbolic links strategy for zero-downtime migration
- **Status**: CONDITIONAL GO pending external dependency documentation

#### Migration Strategy Options

**Option 1: Phased Migration**
- Migrate in stages, update systems incrementally
- Time: 2-3 days | Risk: MEDIUM | Downtime: Minimal

**Option 2: Maintenance Window**
- Migrate all at once, update all systems same day
- Time: 6-8 hours continuous | Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH | Downtime: 4-8 hours

**Option 3: Symbolic Links** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Migrate UDD, create symlinks at old locations
- External systems work unchanged
- Update systems gradually over time
- Time: 2-3 hours migration + gradual updates | Risk: LOW | Downtime: ZERO

#### Next Phase

**Pending**: Execute UDD hybrid migration with symbolic links strategy
- Move UDD Python project to `tools/unified_data_dictionary/` (preserves functionality)
- Extract reference data (schemas, mappings, templates) to Standards root
- Create symbolic links (junction points) at old UDD locations
- External systems continue working via symlinks
- Update external systems gradually post-migration (no rush)
