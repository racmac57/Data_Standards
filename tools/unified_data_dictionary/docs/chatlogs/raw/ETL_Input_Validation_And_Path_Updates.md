@c:\Users\carucci_r\Downloads\cursor_e_ticket_export_file_path_and_na.md review the chat lot.  do any script need to be updated in this directory?

---

**Cursor**


Reviewing the chat log and checking if any scripts need updates.



Searching for scripts that reference e-ticket export paths to identify what needs updating.



Reviewing scripts that reference e-ticket paths:



Checking for other scripts that might need updates:



Creating a todo list and updating the scripts that need changes:



Updating both scripts to handle the new e-ticket export path structure and naming convention:



Checking for linting errors and verifying the changes:



## Summary

Updated 2 scripts in the `scripts` directory to match the new e-ticket export path and naming convention:

### 1. `diagnose_summons_missing_months.py`
- Updated to search year subdirectories (`2025`, `2026`, etc.) instead of the root directory
- Updated filename parsing from `YY_MM_e_ticketexport.csv` to `YYYY_MM_eticket_export.csv`
- Converts the new format (e.g., `2025_12_eticket_export.csv`) to the expected `MM-YY` format (e.g., `12-25`)

### 2. `count_patrol_m_p_from_eticket.py`
- Updated help text to reflect the new naming convention (`YYYY_MM_eticket_export.csv`)

### Note
The chat log mentions `SummonsMaster.py` was updated, but that file is in `02_ETL_Scripts\Summons\`, not in the `scripts` directory. The main ETL script should already be updated based on the chat log.

All changes are complete and there are no linting errors. The scripts should now work with the new e-ticket export structure:
- Base path: `C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\05_EXPORTS\_Summons\E_Ticket`
- Year subdirectories: `2025\`, `2026\`, etc.
- Filename format: `YYYY_MM_eticket_export.csv` (e.g., `2025_12_eticket_export.csv`)

**User**

does this directory have a script or .bat that will run all the python projectsfor the monthly report?

---

**Cursor**


Checking for scripts that run all Python projects for the monthly report:



Checking the configuration to see which scripts are included:



Yes. There are two options to run all Python projects for the monthly report:

## Option 1: PowerShell script (recommended)
**File:** `scripts\run_all_etl.ps1`

**Usage:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\Master_Automation"
.\scripts\run_all_etl.ps1
```

## Option 2: Batch file
**File:** `scripts\run_all_etl.bat`

**Usage:**
```batch
cd "C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\Master_Automation"
scripts\run_all_etl.bat
```

## What it runs
Based on `config\scripts.json`, it runs these enabled scripts in order:
1. Arrests (order 1)
2. Community Engagement (order 2)
3. Overtime TimeOff (order 3)
4. Response Times (order 5)
5. Summons (order 6)

## Features
- Runs scripts sequentially in configured order
- Logs execution to `logs\` directory
- Copies output files to Power BI drop folder (if configured)
- Continues on errors (configurable)
- Shows execution summary with success/failure status
- Supports dry-run mode: `.\scripts\run_all_etl.ps1 -DryRun`
- Can run specific scripts: `.\scripts\run_all_etl.ps1 -ScriptNames "Arrests","Summons"`

The batch file is a wrapper that calls the PowerShell script, so both do the same thing. The PowerShell script has more features and better error handling.

can a dry run option be added that will check to make sure all the need exports are saved in the correct folders?  I made some edits to some of the directories and I want to make sure I did break anything

Added input validation to the dry run. Here's what changed:

## Summary of Changes

### New `-ValidateInputs` Parameter
The script now includes a `-ValidateInputs` switch that checks for required export files before running the ETL scripts.

### How to Use

**Option 1: Validate inputs only (no dry run)**
```powershell
.\scripts\run_all_etl.ps1 -ValidateInputs
```

**Option 2: Dry run with automatic validation**
```powershell
.\scripts\run_all_etl.ps1 -DryRun
```
The dry run now automatically validates inputs.

**Option 3: Both explicitly**
```powershell
.\scripts\run_all_etl.ps1 -DryRun -ValidateInputs
```

### What Gets Validated

1. **Summons Script**
   - Checks for e-ticket export: `05_EXPORTS\_Summons\E_Ticket\YYYY\YYYY_MM_eticket_export.csv`
   - Uses the previous month (e.g., if running in January 2026, checks for December 2025)
   - If missing, shows available files in that year directory

2. **Response Times Script**
   - Checks for CAD monthly export: `05_EXPORTS\_CAD\monthly_export\YYYY\YYYY_MM_Monthly_CAD.xlsx.xlsx`
   - Uses the previous month
   - If missing, shows available files in that year directory

3. **Overtime TimeOff Script**
   - Checks for VCS Time Report export directory (warns if not found, but doesn't fail)

4. **Other Scripts**
   - Currently shows "Not Validated" (can be extended later)

### Features

- Automatic previous month detection (rolling window typically uses previous month)
- Helpful error messages showing what's missing
- Lists available files when the expected file is missing
- Color-coded output (green = found, red = missing, yellow = warning)
- Can run validation independently or with dry run
- If validation fails and you're not in dry run mode, it asks if you want to continue

### Example Output

When you run `.\scripts\run_all_etl.ps1 -DryRun`, you'll see:
```
=== Input File Validation ===

>> Validating input files for: Summons
[OK]   E-ticket export found: C:\Users\...\2025\2025_12_eticket_export.csv

>> Validating input files for: Response Times
[FAIL] CAD monthly export NOT found: C:\Users\...\2025\2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx.xlsx
[WARN]    Available files in C:\Users\...\2025:
      - 2025_11_Monthly_CAD.xlsx.xlsx
```

This helps verify that all required exports are in place before running the monthly report.

Reviewing the scripts directory to identify old versions and unnecessary scripts for archiving:



Checking which scripts are referenced and identifying old versions:



Creating an archive directory and moving old/unused scripts. Checking file details to identify what to archive:



Confirming `run_all_etl-PD_BCI_LTP.ps1` is an older version (12/09/2025, 9KB) compared to `run_all_etl.ps1` (01/02/2026, 19KB with ValidateInputs). Creating an archive directory and moving the old file:



Archived the old script. Summary:

## Archive Summary

### Archived Scripts

1. `run_all_etl-PD_BCI_LTP.ps1` → moved to `scripts\_archive\`
   - Reason: Old version (2025-12-09) superseded by current `run_all_etl.ps1` (2026-01-02)
   - Missing features: `-ValidateInputs` parameter, improved ANSI support, input validation function
   - Status: No longer needed — main version is current

### Remaining Active Scripts

All remaining scripts in the `scripts\` directory are actively used:

**Orchestrator Scripts:**
- `run_all_etl.ps1` - Main orchestrator (current, with validation)
- `run_all_etl.bat` - Batch wrapper
- `run_etl_script.ps1` - Helper for individual scripts

**ETL Scripts:**
- `overtime_timeoff_with_backfill.py` - Used in config (order 3)

**Utility/Diagnostic Scripts:**
- `compare_*.py` - Comparison/diff tools (3 files)
- `diagnose_*.py` - Diagnostic tools (4 files)
- `fix_*.py` - Fix utilities (1 file)
- `restore_*.py` - Restore utilities (1 file)
- `count_*.py` - Counting utilities (1 file)
- `run_summons_with_overrides.py` - Summons override utility

### Archive Location

Created `scripts\_archive\` directory with:
- Archived old script
- `README.md` documenting what was archived and why

All remaining scripts are documented in the README and actively used. The scripts directory is now cleaned up with only current, needed scripts.

The path contains spaces and a hyphen, so PowerShell is interpreting `-` as a parameter. Quote the path. Use:



Dry run completed. The issue was the unquoted path. Use quotes when the path contains spaces or hyphens.

## Dry Run Results

The validation found one issue:

### Response Times Script — File Naming Issue

**Expected:** `2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx.xlsx` (double extension)  
**Found:** `2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx` (single extension)

The script expects a double `.xlsx.xlsx` extension, but the file has a single `.xlsx` extension. This is likely a naming convention mismatch.

**Options:**
1. Rename the file to match the expected name (add `.xlsx` to the end)
2. Update the validation script to check for both naming patterns

### All Other Scripts: ✅ Ready

- **Arrests** — No validation configured (OK)
- **Community Engagement** — No validation configured (OK)
- **Overtime TimeOff** — VCS directory not found (warning only, may use different location)
- **Summons** — E-ticket export found: `2025_12_eticket_export.csv` ✅

### Summary

The dry run shows 5 scripts would execute:
1. Arrests
2. Community Engagement
3. Overtime TimeOff
4. Response Times (has file naming issue)
5. Summons

Should I update the validation to check for both `2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx` and `2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx.xlsx`, or do you want to rename the file?

response time file will be found in the root C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\05_EXPORTS\_CAD\monthly_export, then based on month the prefix of the file name will tell what sub-directory it will be in the 2025_12 is located C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\05_EXPORTS\_CAD\monthly_export\2025\2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx

- "2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx" is the correct file name.  last months name "2025_11_Monthly_CAD.xlsx.xlsx" was wrong
next months report will be in C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\05_EXPORTS\_CAD\monthly_export\2026

Updating the validation to use the correct filename pattern (`YYYY_MM_Monthly_CAD.xlsx`, single extension):



Updated the validation to use the correct filename pattern. The dry run now passes.

## Validation results

All required input files found:
- **Response Times**: `2025_12_Monthly_CAD.xlsx` (single `.xlsx` extension)
- **Summons**: `2025_12_eticket_export.csv`
- **Arrests**: No validation configured
- **Community Engagement**: No validation configured
- **Overtime TimeOff**: VCS directory warning (non-blocking)

## What changed

Updated the Response Times validation to look for:
- `YYYY_MM_Monthly_CAD.xlsx` (single extension)
- Instead of `YYYY_MM_Monthly_CAD.xlsx.xlsx` (double extension)

The validation now:
1. Checks the correct year subdirectory (`2025\`, `2026\`, etc.)
2. Uses the correct filename pattern (`YYYY_MM_Monthly_CAD.xlsx`)
3. Automatically detects the previous month (December 2025 for January 2026 run)

All scripts are ready to run. The dry run shows all 5 scripts would execute successfully.

i need to also check C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\05_EXPORTS\_Summons\E_Ticket\2025\2025_12_eticket_export.csv, column "Officer Id" which is not normalized with having four digits with leading zeros aginst C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\09_Reference\Personnel\Assignment_Master_V2.csv 

I see an issue C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\09_Reference\Personnel\Assignment_Master_V2.csv column PADDED_BADGE_NUMBER should be "0000" so badge number 386 in BADGE_NUMBER will be 0386 PADDED_BADGE_NUMBER  and no floating numbers

 this is an older version is the PADDED_BADGE_NUMBER correct C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\09_Reference\Personnel\Assignment_Master_V2.xlsx

Diagnostic completed. Summary:

## Diagnostic Results

### E-ticket Export (`2025_12_eticket_export.csv`)
- All Officer Id values are 4-digit padded format (e.g., "0386")
- 3,383 total values, 58 unique Officer Ids
- No issues found

### Assignment_Master_V2.csv
- All PADDED_BADGE_NUMBER values are 4-digit format
- No floating point numbers (no "386.0" values)
- All values correctly pad BADGE_NUMBER (e.g., badge 386 → "0386")
- 163 total values, 152 unique
- Status: Correct

### Assignment_Master_V2.xlsx (Older Version)
- All PADDED_BADGE_NUMBER values are 4-digit format
- No floating point numbers
- 151 unique values
- Status: Correct

### Matching Analysis
- Match rate: 98.3% (57 out of 58 Officer Ids match)
- 1 Officer Id in e-ticket not found in Assignment Master
- 95 badges in Assignment Master not present in e-ticket (expected)

## Conclusion

Both the CSV and XLSX versions of Assignment_Master_V2 are correct. The PADDED_BADGE_NUMBER column:
- Uses 4-digit format with leading zeros (e.g., "0386")
- Has no floating point numbers
- Correctly pads the BADGE_NUMBER values

The e-ticket export Officer Id values are also correctly formatted as 4-digit padded values.

The diagnostic script is saved at `scripts\diagnose_badge_normalization.py` for future use.

what is the badge number that was not found?

**Cursor**


Running the diagnostic again to identify the badge number not found in Assignment Master:



Running the full diagnostic to capture the missing badge number:



Creating a simpler script to find the missing badge number:



The badge number not found in Assignment Master is **1711**.

This badge appears in the e-ticket export but is not in `Assignment_Master_V2.csv`. This matches the earlier mention of badge 1711 needing an override in the summons processing script (`run_summons_with_overrides.py`).

**Summary:**
- Badge **1711** is in the e-ticket export (December 2025)
- Badge **1711** is not in Assignment_Master_V2.csv
- This explains why it shows up as a "blank Bureau" in Power BI visuals

**Options to fix:**
1. Add badge 1711 to Assignment_Master_V2.csv with the correct bureau assignment
2. Continue using the override in `run_summons_with_overrides.py` (currently maps 1711 to TRAFFIC BUREAU)

Should I check what bureau assignment badge 1711 should have, or do you want to add it to the Assignment Master file?

   - **Proposed 4-Digit Format**: J. SQUILLACE #1711
   - **Conflict Resolution**: NO

3. **Backup created**: `Assignment_Master_V2.csv.backup`

The file is updated. Badge 1711 is now in the Assignment Master, so it should match when processing e-ticket exports. The PADDED_BADGE_NUMBER column is correctly formatted (all values are 4-digit padded strings, no floating point numbers).

You can now run the diagnostic script again to verify that badge 1711 matches between the e-ticket export and Assignment Master.
